ResNet (Residual Network):Proposed by Kaiming He et al. to solve vanishing gradient problems

Key Features:  
1.Residual Blocks: Learn identity mappings with skip connections to prevent vanishing gradients  
2.Model variants: Includes ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and deeper architectures for scalable feature learning

Typically composed of 4 residual stages with increasing depth (e.g., ResNet34: 3, 4, 6, 3 blocks)

Types:  
1.Basic Block (2 convolutional layers)  
2.Bottleneck Block (3 convolutional layers)

To execute the program, only need to select one combinations.
